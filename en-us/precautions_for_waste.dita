                <li id="li_wrq_xkf_bhb">The reagents contain chemical components as previously
                    described (For details see <b>2. PRECAUTIONS FOR HANDLING</b>). Follow any
                    applicable regulations for disposal. If flushing down the drain, use generous
                    amount of water when discarding to prevent the formation of explosive metal
                    azides. Do not use acids to decontaminate the waste, since sodium azide with
                    acids liberates toxic gases.</li>
                <li id="li_xrq_xkf_bhb">Handle any medical waste produced by this assay in
                    compliance with waste-related regulations in each country or region.</li>
                <li id="li_uk2_ykf_bhb">When any liquid such as specimen or assay waste is splashed,
                    wipe and disinfect the whole area with an appropriate disinfectant such as
                    sodium hypochlorite or ethanol, conforming to the instituteâ€™s biosafety
                    requirements.</li>
